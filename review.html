<p align="center">★★★☆☆</p><br>
<p>Tarzan is a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of the natural world. No other novel this year captured the ubiquity of trees as perceptibly as this one. Powers's arboreal protagonists range from a father-daughter pair of chestnut farmers to an aging Vietnam veteran who lives in a redwood and an engineering student who communicates with a blight-resistant American elm. In the process, the book transports the reader into a parallel universe, one governed by the language of roots and leaves. This is a novel that doesn't merely tell an entertaining story; it allows the reader to feel the rhythms of the woods.</p><br>

<p> The Swallows is a towering achievement, a dazzling literary adventure that captures the ache of loss and the struggle for meaning in a cold, beautiful world. At its heart is Theo Decker, a young man whose life is upended when his mother is killed in a terrorist attack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Adrift in the aftermath, Theo clings to the one tangible connection he has left: a small, captivating painting of a goldfinch. Tartt's prose is exquisite, her characters richly drawn, and her plot utterly compelling. This is a novel that illuminates the ways in which art, love, and loyalty can redeem us in the face of overwhelming tragedy. It is a masterpiece.</p><br>

<p>Follow Me To Ground is at once a murder mystery, a coming-of-age narrative and a celebration of nature. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps. The story is full of beauty and heartbreak, but Owens has created a story that is as layered as the marshes of the North Carolina coast, where it is set. This book is sure to be a classic of our time.</p>

<p>Me: Moth is a powerful first novel that explores the complex relationships between fathers and sons, friends and enemies.

Hosseini's prose is elegant and evocative, and his characters are richly drawn and deeply sympathetic. The novel's themes of guilt, forgiveness, and the lasting impact of our choices will linger with readers long after the final page is turned. 'The Kite Runner' is a masterful debut that marks the arrival of a major new literary talent.</p><br>

<p>Clap When You Land is a remarkable memoir of a young woman who, kept out of school, leaves her survivalist family and goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge University. Westover's story, told with rare clarity and heart-rending honesty, transforms into a profound meditation on the meaning of education. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</p><br>

<p>The Silent Queen is a spellbinding achievement, a modern classic that beautifully blends the mythic and the intimate. Miller's reimagining of the Greek goddess Circe is a revelation - a fiercely feminist tale of power, transformation, and the fierce love of a mother for her son. Circe's journey from a sheltered nymph to a powerful sorceress is told with lyrical prose and vivid, immersive detail. This is a book that transports the reader to a world of gods and monsters, while also speaking profoundly to the universal human experience. 'Circe' is a masterpiece, a book that will be read and cherished for generations to come.</p><br>
